# Raw English — Product Backlog

## 🔴 High Priority
- [ ] **Payment Gate** — On the 5th of each month, app locks and shows payment screen. Options: PIX, Stripe, or manual unlock via admin panel. Start simple (manual unlock by André), evolve to auto-payment.
- [ ] **Option C: Voice Mode** — Full voice conversations. AI speaks (OpenAI TTS), student speaks (Whisper). Mic button already in place, needs TTS output.

## 🟡 Medium Priority
- [ ] **Student Progress Dashboard** — Track topics practiced, session count, error patterns, vocabulary learned. Monthly reports for André + HR (B2B clients).
- [ ] **Custom Domain** — rawenglish.com.br or similar
- [ ] **Intermediate Level Topics** — Build out topic list for intermediate students (currently only beginner & advanced have custom topics)

## 🟢 Nice to Have
- [ ] **Gamification** — Points, streaks, badges for daily practice
- [ ] **Company Portal** — HR managers can see their employees' progress
- [ ] **AI Pronunciation Scoring** — Rate student pronunciation and give feedback
- [ ] **Lesson Recordings** — Save past conversations for review
- [ ] **Native App** (React Native or Flutter) — if PWA isn't enough
